DOE for AMT

This is a set of scripts to control AMT in an experimental design framework.

The idea is that even numbered experiments are run on the sandbox. Once the
experiment has been tested on the sandbox, the experiment is replicated
to an odd numbered experiment and run on the production site. There is 
currently no logic to support this, but the framework is there.

In fact, this is nothing more than a glorified collection of bash scripts
that keep me sane when interfacing with AMT. Feel free to use and modify.
